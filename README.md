# pi-live-throughput

A single-line live tokens/sec display for the [Pi coding agent](https://pi.dev).

While an assistant response streams, the extension shows its rolling throughput,
average throughput, estimated output tokens, elapsed time, and model:

```text
⚡ 92.3 tok/s · avg 84.5 tok/s · 1.2k tok · 14.2s · deepseek-v4-flash
```

When streaming finishes, it replaces the live metrics with a final summary that
stays visible until the next assistant response starts. Prompt fields are added
when Pi exposes usable normalized values:

```text
✓ 512 tok in 2.0s · 256 tok/s avg · peak 319 tok/s · input 1.2k tok · cache read 8.0k tok · TTFT 420ms · approx. prompt 2900 tok/s · deepseek-v4-flash
```

Live figures use Pi's cumulative provider-reported `usage.output` value when it
advances during streaming. Providers that expose usage only after completion
fall back to text, thinking, and tool-call delta estimates, identified by
`est.` rates and `~` token counts. The final token count always uses the
provider-reported value.

## Prompt and cache metrics

Pi normalizes prompt usage into separate `input`, `cacheRead`, and `cacheWrite`
counts. `input` is the uncached, non-cache-write portion; cache-read tokens are
shown separately and are never described as tokens processed by the model.
Because Pi initializes unavailable usage fields to zero, this extension reports
only positive prompt/cache counts rather than presenting a zero as confirmed
provider data.

TTFT (time to first output) is measured from Pi's `before_provider_request`
boundary to the first substantive text, thinking, or tool-call output event. It
is omitted if either boundary is unavailable. TTFT is an end-to-end observation:
it can include network latency, provider queueing and routing, cache lookup, and
model startup, not just model prefill.

`approx. prompt` is a best-effort estimate calculated as
`(input + cacheWrite) / TTFT`. It is shown only when both a positive processed
prompt-token count and a positive TTFT are available. Cache-read tokens are
excluded. The estimate is not true model prefill throughput because its timing
contains the end-to-end latency above.

## Install

Install from npm:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-live-throughput
```

Alternatively, install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/apetersson/pi-live-throughput
```

For local development, install the checkout instead:

```bash
pi install /absolute/path/to/pi-live-throughput
```

Use `/reload` if Pi was already running when you installed or changed the
extension.

## Commands

The widget is enabled above the editor by default.

| Command              | Effect                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/throughput`        | Toggle the display on or off                           |
| `/throughput on`     | Enable the previously selected display mode            |
| `/throughput off`    | Hide the display                                       |
| `/throughput widget` | Enable the full single-line widget above the editor    |
| `/throughput status` | Enable a compact footer status instead                 |
| `/throughput reset`  | Reset an active measurement or clear the final summary |

## Development

This project uses pnpm only. The verification command checks Prettier formatting,
strict TypeScript compilation, zero-warning ESLint, and the test suite:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run verify
```

Apply formatting with `pnpm run format`. Run individual checks with
`pnpm run format:check`, `pnpm run check`, `pnpm run lint`, or `pnpm run test`.

To load the local extension without installing it:

```bash
pi -e ./src/index.ts
```
